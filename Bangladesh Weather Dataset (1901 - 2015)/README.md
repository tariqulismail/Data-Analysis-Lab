# 🌏 Bangladesh Weather Analysis Dataset (1900-2023)

## Integrating ❄Kaggle Dataset to Python 🐍 to SQLSERVER 🛢 can enhance data analysis 📊 by allowing to perform advanced analysis and data manipulation.

### ✅ Overview: The dataset provides a comprehensive look at the weather patterns in Bangladesh from 1900 to 2023, focusing on temperature (tem), rainfall (rain), and seasonality. The data also categorizes the weather into temperature (temp_category) and rainfall (rain_category) levels such as Low, Medium, and High, allowing for nuanced insights into the country's climatic changes over the years.

### ✅Monsoon and Rainfall Patterns

▶ Rainy Season (June to September): The monsoon season is the most defining aspect of Bangladesh's climate, bringing the highest rainfall of the year. Rainfall levels frequently surpass 500 mm during peak months, with some years recording more than 700 mm in July and August. This period is marked by a "High" temperature category and either "Medium" or "High" rain classifications, reflecting the tropical climate's hallmark — heavy, sustained downpours coupled with hot, humid conditions.

### ✅Climate Variability and Shifts

▶The dataset reflects notable variability in the rain_temp_ratio, particularly during the monsoon and summer months. In some years, an unusually high ratio indicates heavy rains compared to temperature, while in others, a lower ratio points to drier conditions despite high temperatures.

▶Over the decades, there are indications of slight warming trends, with increasing instances of "High" temperature classifications spreading into typically cooler seasons like late autumn and spring. This shift could hint at broader climate changes, including global warming impacts.

### ✅Noteworthy Observations

▶Heatwaves and Droughts: Some years, particularly in the mid-20th century, saw extended dry spells during traditionally wet months, possibly indicative of periodic droughts affecting the region. This is evident from the drastic fluctuations in rainfall categories, where "Low" rain is observed even during peak rainy months.

▶Unusual Rainfall Events: The data also shows years with unexpectedly high rainfall outside the regular monsoon window, suggesting potential cyclonic activity or unusual weather patterns affecting Bangladesh.


### ✅Conclusion: This dataset provides a vivid picture of Bangladesh's complex and dynamic climate, underscoring the challenges of managing agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure in a region highly dependent on predictable weather patterns. The ongoing variability and emerging trends, particularly in temperature increases and irregular rainfall patterns, emphasize the need for robust climate adaptation strategies.
