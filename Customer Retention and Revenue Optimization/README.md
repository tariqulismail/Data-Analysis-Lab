# Customer Analytics for Retention and Revenue Optimization

## üìã Overview
Project Overview
This comprehensive analytics solution leverages SQL data analysis to help SaaS businesses optimize customer retention and revenue generation. The project delivers actionable insights through a multi-dimensional approach that connects customer data, subscription information, payment history, and user engagement metrics.
Data Architecture
The project is built on a robust database schema consisting of four interconnected tables that capture the complete customer journey:

Customers Table: Core customer demographic information, including geographical distribution
Subscriptions Table: Plan details, subscription timeline, and current status
Payments Table: Transactional data including payment methods and financial metrics
User Activity Table: Behavioral data showing feature engagement patterns

Data Flow Process
The implementation process follows a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow:

Data Generation - Using Python's Faker library to generate realistic synthetic data
Data Transformation - Cleaning, formatting, and validating the generated datasets
Data Loading - Transferring from CSV files to Oracle database
SQL Analysis - Executing the 13 analytical queries for business insights
Visualization & Reporting - Presenting results in actionable formats

Analysis Framework
The 13 SQL analyses are strategically designed to address key business questions and are categorized into four core business dimensions:


## 1. Revenue Analytics
Analysis 1: Monthly Revenue Trend
Analysis 4: Top 3 Countries by Total Revenue
Analysis 6: Revenue by Plan Type
Analysis 7: Average Revenue per Active User (ARPU)
Analysis 10: Revenue growth over time by plan or country
Analysis 11: ARPU by segment
2. Customer Engagement
Analysis 2: Active vs Inactive Customers
Analysis 5: Feature Engagement Score
Analysis 12: Feature popularity trends for product development
3. Retention Strategies
Analysis 3: Churn Rate Analysis
Analysis 8: Customers with Low Engagement but High Payment (Churn Risk)
Analysis 9: Retention strategies for high-paying low-engagement customers
4. Predictive Insights
Analysis 13: Churn prediction based on usage + payment + subscription data
