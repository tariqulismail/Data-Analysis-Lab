## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project is built on a robust database schema and a structured ETL data flow process, ensuring data integrity and efficient processing.

### Database Schema

The database consists of four interconnected tables that capture the complete customer journey, from initial sign-up to ongoing engagement and payment history.

* **Customers Table**: Contains core customer demographic information, including geographical data.
* **Subscriptions Table**: Stores details about subscription plans, timelines, and the current status of each subscription.
* **Payments Table**: Holds all transactional data, including payment methods and key financial metrics.
* **User Activity Table**: Tracks behavioral data, providing insights into feature engagement and user interaction patterns.


### Data Flow Process

The implementation follows a standard ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow to ensure data is accurately and efficiently processed from its source to the analytical environment.

1.  **Data Generation**: Realistic synthetic data is created using Python's Faker library to simulate real-world customer information.
2.  **Data Transformation**: The generated data is cleaned, formatted, and validated to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3.  **Data Loading**: The transformed data is loaded from CSV files into an Oracle database, ready for analysis.
4.  **SQL Analysis**: A suite of 13 analytical queries is executed to derive meaningful business insights.
5.  **Visualization & Reporting**: The results are presented in actionable formats, such as dashboards and reports, for easy interpretation by business users.

## üìä Analysis Framework

The 13 SQL analyses are strategically categorized into four core business dimensions, providing a comprehensive and multi-faceted view of your SaaS business performance.


### üí∞ Revenue Analytics

These analyses focus on understanding and optimizing revenue streams.

* **Analysis 1**: Monthly Revenue Trend
```SQL
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(Year FROM payment_date) AS Year,   
    to_char(payment_date, 'Month') AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM saas_payments
GROUP BY EXTRACT(Year FROM payment_date), to_char(payment_date, 'Month')
ORDER BY EXTRACT(Year FROM payment_date) , to_char(payment_date, 'Month');
```


* **Analysis 4**: Top 3 Countries by Total Revenue
* **Analysis 6**: Revenue by Plan Type
* **Analysis 7**: Average Revenue per Active User (ARPU)
* **Analysis 10**: Revenue growth over time by plan or country
* **Analysis 11**: ARPU by segment

### üëã Customer Engagement

This category provides insights into how users are interacting with your product.

* **Analysis 2**: Active vs Inactive Customers
* **Analysis 5**: Feature Engagement Score
* **Analysis 12**: Feature popularity trends for product development

### üìâ Retention Strategies

These analyses help in identifying at-risk customers and developing strategies to improve retention.

* **Analysis 3**: Churn Rate Analysis
* **Analysis 8**: Customers with Low Engagement but High Payment (Churn Risk)
* **Analysis 9**: Retention strategies for high-paying low-engagement customers

### üîÆ Predictive Insights

This area focuses on forward-looking analytics to proactively manage customer churn.

* **Analysis 13**: Churn prediction based on usage, payment, and subscription data

### Data Generation

* Utilizes the **Python Faker library** for the creation of realistic and anonymized synthetic data, allowing for robust testing and development without compromising user privacy.
* The data generation scripts are configurable, allowing you to specify the sample size and date ranges to match your specific analytical needs.

### ETL Pipeline

* A **Python-based pipeline** handles the extraction of data from CSV files, its transformation, and loading into the database.
* The powerful **Pandas** library is used for all data transformation and cleaning tasks, ensuring data quality and consistency.
* The pipeline is optimized for batch loading into an **Oracle database**, providing a scalable and reliable data foundation.

### SQL Analysis Environment

* Leverages the power of **Oracle SQL** to perform complex queries, aggregations, and analytical functions.
* The SQL scripts are designed to conduct in-depth temporal analysis and sophisticated customer segmentation.

### Output Integration

* The results of the analyses can be easily formatted for seamless integration with leading BI tools like **Tableau or Power BI**.
* The system supports scheduled execution of the analytical scripts and can export the results to various formats, including CSV and JSON.
